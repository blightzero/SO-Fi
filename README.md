Secure on-demand Wi-Fi

SO-Fi builds on the broadcast character of the IEEE 802.11 wireless medium to instantly achieve a complete discovery scope covering all devices in communication range. Realizing content discovery outside of a secure network association, SO-Fi also provides communication confidentiality, state-of-the-art 802.11 network security, DoS robustness, and user authentication.
